# Mark and Sweep Garbage collector C
This program demonstrates a basic implementation of a mark-and-sweep garbage collector in C, using a linked list as an example data structure. The program is able to handle dynamic memory allocation, pointers,
and data structures such as linked lists and trees.
## usage
To use the garbage collector, simply call the mark_and_sweep() function. This function iterates through the linked list, marking each node that is in use and then sweeping through the list again to free any nodes that are not marked.
